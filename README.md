  <h2>Goal/s</h2>
  <p>Briefly and clearly describe the measurable goal/s of your website here.</p>
  <p>The goal of our website is that we create the website for business. Specifically, we create the website for booking homestay online. The landlords who want to advertise thier homstays and contact with customers quicker have to rent us to post their homestays in our website and advertise their homstay for them. Therefore, our group, investor and landlords are linked together and get the profit from that. Moreover, we also provide some intestesing services which most people concern about such as cheap tours and reating motorbike.<br></br><b>Reason:</b>Nowadays, there are more travellers and couples looking for homstays rather than hotel to stay in Vietnam because of cost and some advantages of it. Vietnam Booking will offer great travel experiences by helping travelers find and stay at places that are unique. We believe independently owned properties represent the best way to experience a new city, culture or country, because they are owned and operated by local small business owners who often know more than anyone about the culture, customs and “off the beaten path” experiences within their hometowns. </p>
